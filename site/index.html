			<h2>These days</h2>
			don't do too much talking
			These days, these days
			These days I seem to think a lot
			About the things that I forgot to do
			And all the times I had the chance to.
			I've stopped my rambling
			I don't do too much gambling
			These days, these days
			These days I seem to think about
			How all the changes came about my ways
			And I wonder if I'd see another highway
			I had a lover
			I don't think I'll risk another
			These days, these days
			And if I seem to be afraid
			To live the life that I have made in song
			It's just that I've been losing so long
			I've stopped my dreaming
			I won't do too much scheming
			These days, these days
			These days I sit on corner stones
			And count the time in quarter tones to ten
			Please don't confront me with my failures
			I had not forgotten them

				<h2>Sunday morning</h2>
				Sunday morning, brings the dawn in
				It's just a restless feeling by my side
				Early dawning, Sunday morning
				It's just the wasted years so close behind
				Watch out, the world's behind you
				There's always someone around you who will call
				It's nothing at all
				Sunday morning and I'm falling
				I've got a feeling I don't want to know
				Early dawning, Sunday morning
				It's all the streets you crossed, not so long ago
				Watch out, the world's behind you
				There's always someone around you who will call
				It's nothing at all
				Watch out, the world's behind you
				There's always someone around you who will call
				It's nothing at all
				Sunday morning
				Sunday morning
				Sunday morning
